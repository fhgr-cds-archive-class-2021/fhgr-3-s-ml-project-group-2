# Introduction
The clustering project is **not** related to the main project (prediction of housing prices) of the course CDS-106.

This was a sub project to experiment with clustering on a dataset for [salaries](salaries.csv).

## Clustering project
The project was an assignment of the course CDS-106.

This project helped to practice data handling/preprocessing

Besides that, it helped to practice how to visualize data coming from a clustering algorithm and visualization in general.

The results for this project are all available in a structured jupyter notebook: [clustering.ipynb](clustering.ipynb).
